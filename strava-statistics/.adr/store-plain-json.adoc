= Storing plain json in database

== Issue

There is a difference between https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json[Swagger contract] and actual data we are receiving during http calls such as `/athlete/activities` or `activity`.
For example, I see data about heart rate that I don't find in API description or generated classes.

[source,json]
----
{
    "has_heartrate": true,
    "average_heartrate": 138.5,
    "max_heartrate": 169
}
----

== Decision

I decided to store plain json response to the database.
It will allow me to have the maximum of available information, even if the suddenly disappear.
